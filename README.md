  - Eliza’s setup is straightforward, with a **Quickstart Guide** to help new users create and deploy agents quickly. The system is designed for both novice developers and advanced users seeking deep customization.

### 2. Quickstart Guide

- **Prerequisites**:
  - Ensure installation of **Node.js** (JavaScript runtime) and **pnpm** (package manager).
  - Set up the development environment to run Eliza agents.

- **Installation**:
  - Clone the Eliza repository from GitHub and install dependencies using pnpm.
  - Build the project and start the application, ensuring all components are correctly initialized.

- **Loading Default Character**:
  - After installation, the Quickstart Guide assists in setting up a default Eliza agent. This includes configuring the agent to run within a specific platform (e.g., Discord or Telegram).

- **Creating and Running Custom Agents**:
  - Custom agents are defined by creating character files in JSON format, specifying traits, knowledge, and behaviors.
  - Instructions provided for running these agents in various platforms, making the process highly flexible.

- **Next Steps**:
  - Explore creating custom actions (which define agent responses) and advanced configurations to fully customize agent behavior.

### 3. Core Concepts

- **Character Files**:
  - Character files are key to configuring agents, using **JSON format** to define responses, knowledge, behavior patterns, and actions.
  - These files make it easy to tailor an agent’s personality, including how it interacts with users, what knowledge it retains, and how it adapts over time.

- **Agents**:
  - Agents represent the autonomous entities in Eliza. They are responsible for running the logic based on predefined characters and actions.
  - Agents interact with users, process data, and execute tasks autonomously, all while adhering to their unique characteristics.

- **Providers**:
  - Providers are external data sources or services integrated into Eliza agents. They allow agents to fetch and use live data from APIs or other services to enhance their decision-making process.

- **Actions**:
  - Actions are predefined behaviors that agents execute in response to user input. These actions may include replying to a message, performing a task, or interacting with external systems.
  - The system supports both simple actions (e.g., sending messages) and more complex behaviors (e.g., invoking external services, handling data).

- **Evaluators**:
  - Evaluators assess the quality and relevance of incoming data (e.g., user inputs or external sources).
  - They play a crucial role in decision-making, enabling agents to filter, prioritize, and process information more effectively.
